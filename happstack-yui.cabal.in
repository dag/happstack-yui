Build-Type    : Simple

Description :
  Bundles YUI 3.5.1 and includes a \"combo handler\" for use in Happstack
  which concatenates YUI modules server-side to send in a single HTTP
  request.  The YUI bundle is embedded in the library with Template Haskell
  which means the files are served directly from memory, and also that you
  can compile and deploy a single executable without having to worry about
  deploying the YUI files as well.
  .
  The benefits of using this over the Yahoo! CDN is that you can work
  offline and that you can host YUI yourself without sacrificing the
  benefits of \"combo loading\".
  .
  The versioning scheme of this package is that the first part is the
  targeted Happstack series plus the bundled YUI version, such that 7351
  means \"Happstack 7, YUI 3.5.1\".  The second part is the major version
  of this package itself, as defined by the Package Versioning Policy.
  .
  In a future release, the plan is to add more utilities than just a
  bundled YUI, for example a combo handler for YUI modules written using
  JMacro, a bridge between HSX and YUI Node objects and tools for working
  with the YUI CSS modules.
