Cabal-Version : >= 1.10
Build-Type    : Simple

Description :
  Bundles YUI YUI_VERSION and includes a \"combo handler\" for use in
  Happstack which concatenates YUI modules server-side to send in a single
  HTTP request.  The YUI bundle can be embedded in compiled code with
  Template Haskell (install with @-fembed@) which means the files are
  served directly from memory, and also that you can compile and deploy a
  single executable without having to worry about deploying the YUI files
  as well.
  .
  The benefits of using this over the Yahoo! CDN is that you can work
  offline and that you can host YUI yourself without sacrificing the
  benefits of \"combo loading\".
  .
  The versioning scheme of this package is that the first part is the
  targeted Happstack series plus the bundled YUI version, such that 7351
  means \"Happstack 7, YUI 3.5.1\".  The second part is the major version
  of this package itself, as defined by the Package Versioning Policy.
  .
  The package also includes some utilities for working with the YUI CSS
  modules and for using HSX to create YUI Node objects with JMacro.  In a
  future release, the plan is to add more utilities, for example a combo
  handler for YUI modules written using JMacro, tools for making it
  easier to work with modules like Uploader and Pjax and a quasi-quoter for
  compile-time syntax checked YQL queries.
  .
