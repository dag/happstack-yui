Build-Type    : Simple

Description :
  Bundles YUI YUI_VERSION and includes a \"combo handler\" for use in
  Happstack which concatenates YUI modules server-side to send in a single
  HTTP request.  The YUI bundle is embedded in the library with Template
  Haskell which means the files are served directly from memory, and also
  that you can compile and deploy a single executable without having to
  worry about deploying the YUI files as well.
  .
  The benefits of using this over the Yahoo! CDN is that you can work
  offline and that you can host YUI yourself without sacrificing the
  benefits of \"combo loading\".
  .
  The versioning scheme of this package is that the first part is the
  targeted Happstack series plus the bundled YUI version, such that 7351
  means \"Happstack 7, YUI 3.5.1\".  The second part is the major version
  of this package itself, as defined by the Package Versioning Policy.
  .
  In a future release, the plan is to add more utilities than just a
  bundled YUI, for example a combo handler for YUI modules written using
  JMacro, a bridge between HSX and YUI Node objects and tools for working
  with the YUI CSS modules.
  .
